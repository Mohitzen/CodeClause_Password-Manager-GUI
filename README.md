# Password-Manager-GUI
This is a window based application made with swing, a GUI framework of Java using which we can generate random strong passwords, then, save it with the website name where we used this password to sign-up/login. The password is saved using a simple encrypted algorithm. We can retrieve the decrypted password by authenticating our identity. I have used MySQL table in the backend to store the encrypted passwords.
